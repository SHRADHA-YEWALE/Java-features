# Java Generics
Generics in java means parameterized types to deal with type-safe objects. It allows type like Integer, String, …etc, and user-defined types to be a parameter to methods, classes, and interfaces.

Class, method, or interface which operates on this parameterized type is called a Generic entity.

Note: Generics cannot work with primitive types.

The code example illustrates the use of generics wherein the Player class is an abstract class. FootballPlayer and BasketballPlayer are the classes that manage the players of the football team and basketball team respectively. Both of these classes extend Player class which contain property shared by both of the class. Class Team contains the functionality to manage the activities of all teams.
